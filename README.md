## Programming Problems

1. Given a String “aabbbbddcc” find the longest first repeating index and its length. (Input: “aabbbbddcc” Output:
[2,4] 2 is the index and 4 is the length).
2. Program - Input: “GGGGGRRTTTOO” Output: “G5R2T3O2”.
3. Find the second smallest element in the array.
4. Implement Chain of responsibility design pattern.
5. Given two Strings1 : aabccd11 and String2:aabbccdd11 write a program to return extra
character so that both strings are anagram.
6. Given an array of numbers find the second smallest number. eg {33,4,1,2,99} output : 2
7. Arrange given numbers to form the biggest number.Input- List of numbers : {1, 34, 3, 98, 9, 76, 45, 4} Output –
998764543431
8. Given Input,print the following output: “SSSSSTTPPQ” Output: “5S2T2P1Q”.
9. Given an input String s= "AGBCAPPBLLC" Target : ABC. Find the smallest substring which contains the
target.Result should be {AGFBC}
10. Find out the longest word in a string which is valid and meaningful. Assume dictionary in place having two columns
wordname and isValid(yes/no).

## Threading
1. Print even and odd value using using two threads.T1 prints odd values and T2 prints even values. T1 thread ->
1,T2 thread -> 2,T1 thread ->3,T2 Thread ->4 etc.
2.
